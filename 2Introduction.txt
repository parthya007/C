1) Program in C language is made of tokens.
    Tokens: Parts which makes up the program in C i.e basic building blocks. 

2) Termination of every statement in C ends with a semicolon.

        auto        double      int         struct 
        break       else        long        switch  
        case        enum        register    typedef
        char        extern      return      union
        const       float       short       unsigned
        continue    for         signed      void
        default     goto        sizeof      volatile
