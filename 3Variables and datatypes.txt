1) Variable is a type of memory like a container in which we can store data.

2) Datatype tells about which type of data should go in variable.

3) # Variable is a name which we assign to storage area.
    e.g., int=integer
          char=character
   # Declared by writing 'type variable_name;'
   # Initialized and declared by 'type variable_name = value;'

4) Rules for defining a variable in C:
    # Can contain alphabets, digits and underscore.
    # A variable name can start with an alphabet and underscore only.
    # Can't start with a digit.
    # No whitespace % reserved keywords is allowed.
    # e.g., int harry,
            float harry123,
            char _harry34, etc.

5) FLOW OF A C PROGRAM:
    i]Processing
    ii]Compilation
    iii]Assembly
    iv]Linking
    v]Loading

6) Data types in C
    # Basic data type : int, char, float, double
    # Derived data type : array, pointer, structure, union
    # Enumeraion data type : emum
    # Void data type : void
